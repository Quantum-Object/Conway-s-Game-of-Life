# Conway's Game of Life  

Conwayâ€™s Game of Life is a zero-player cellular automaton where cells evolve based on simple rules.  

## Rules  
1. **Alive cells:**  
   - Survive with 2 or 3 neighbors, otherwise die.  
2. **Dead cells:**  
   - Revive with exactly 3 neighbors.  

## Usage  
Run a simulation with an initial grid, and watch patterns emerge over generations.  

## Examples  
- **Still lifes** (stable patterns)  
- **Oscillators** (repeat cycles)  
- **Gliders** (move across the grid)
