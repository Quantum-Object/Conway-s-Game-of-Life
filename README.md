# Snake Game

A classic Snake game implemented in C++ using the Raylib library. Navigate the snake to eat food, grow longer, and avoid running into walls or yourself!

## Features

- **Simple and Intuitive Controls**: Use arrow keys to navigate the snake.
- **Growing Snake**: Each time the snake eats food, it grows longer.
- **Collision Detection**: Game over if the snake collides with the wall or itself.
- **Dynamic Difficulty**: The speed of the snake increases as it grows.
